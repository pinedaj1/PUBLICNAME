## Usage Instructions

The database and website involves the use of `python` and `postgres15`, as well as several python packages: `flask`, `psycopg2`, `matplotlib`. Make sure these are set up and the dependencies are installed.

The database creation, population, and server deployment can all be done by running `make_database.sh` in a `venv` environment. After running the script, the server will start and can be accessed by going to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## Databases used

Various databases from the [Sustainable Jersey Data Center](https://www.sustainablejersey.com/resources/data-center/)

Municipality topology data from [NJGIN Open Data](https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/newjersey::municipal-boundaries-of-nj)

Topology simplified using [MapShaper](https://mapshaper.org/)
